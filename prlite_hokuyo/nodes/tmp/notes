   1.

      roscd hrl_hokuyo; roslaunch acm0_utm.launch
   2.

      roscd hrl_tilting_hokuyo/src/hrl_tilting_hokuyo
   3.

      python tilt_hokuyo_servo.py -h
   4. Run it with appropriate parameters. For example:
          *

            python tilt_hokuyo_servo.py -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -n0 --save_scan --speed=10 --id=<servo id> --l2=0.035 
   5. You should see the servo tilt the UTM between the two angles that you specified.
   6.

      Once the code runs, it will save the scans in a pkl. (e.g. 2009Oct05_203107_dict.pkl)

      To view the point cloud, use display_3d_mayavi.py (python display_3d_mayavi.py -h)

You're on the right track with continuous rotation. It can be done, you are limited in that between the positions of 300 and 360/0, you don't have any way of knowing exactly where the servo is. If you can live with this, here's the basic concept:

      Set the Operating Angle Limits (CW and CCW - addresses 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09) to zero.

      Use Moving Speed (addresses 0x20[low byte] and 0x21[high byte]) to control speed and direction.

      * See pages 17 and 18 of the AX-12 manual for more details.

      By setting 0x20 and 0x21 to zero, the servo should stop.

      You can monitor the position by watching the values of the Present Position (0x24 and 0x25). Note that this will have a "blind" spot between 300 and 360/0.

Edit : Updated to version DynacomV2.spin 1/15/11. You can now change the baud rate for the dynamixels. It now allows using continuous rotation mode. When using the writedata method to write to a 2 byte control register i.e. goal position, moving speed, etc. write the value (up to 11bits) to the first byte address of the 2 byte control register and the program will write the low/high bytes for you. Also updated the example use file to give examples of using the methods.

If both values for the CW Angle Limit and the CCW Angle Limit are set to 0, an Endless
Turn mode can be implemented by setting the Goal Speed. This feature can be used for
implementing a continuously rotating wheel
