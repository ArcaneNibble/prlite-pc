You need wto things in place for the arm_navigation.launch file to work - first, you need to make sure that you have are publishing a joint state message with positions and velocities for every joint in your robot. Then you need to make sure that the controller is up and running, advertising the correct action (control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectoryAction), and that you have the correct action name set in the move_arm launch file.

fixed dynamixel_dual_joint_controller.py or something like that; it was out of date
