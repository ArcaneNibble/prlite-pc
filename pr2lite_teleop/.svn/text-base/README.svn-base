INSTALLING the pi_teleop ROS PACKAGE:

STEP 1: Install the rosbridge package (Version 1.0)

NOTE: This package uses version 1.0 of rosbridge, not version 2.0.  To get version 1.0, move into your
personal ROS directory and run:

$ svn co http://brown-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/distribution/brown_remotelab/rosbridge
$ cd rosbridge
$ rosmake --rosdep-install

STEP 2: Install mjpeg_server package

Move into your personal ROS directory and run:

$ svn co http://svn.code.sf.net/p/bosch-ros-pkg/code/trunk/stacks/mjpeg_server
$ cd mjpeg_server
$ rosmake --rosdep-install

STEP 3: Install the pi_teleop package

Move into your personal ROS directory, then run the commands:

$ svn co http://pi-robot-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/experimental/pi_teleop
$ cd pi_teleop
$ rosmake --rosdep-install


STEP 4: (Optional but recommended): Install the ROS By Example stack:

If you want to be able to test the pi_teleop package using a simple simulator, then
install the ROS By Example stack as follows.  Move into your personal ROS directory and run:

$ svn co http://ros-by-example.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rbx_vol_1
$ rosmake rbx_vol_1
$ rospack profile

Get the pi_teleop package (if you don't already have it):

STEP 5: Setting up a Web Server

Before using the pi_teleop package, you will need to make the pi_teleop directory accessible to a web server
running on your robot.  If you are already running the Apache webserver and you know how to add access
to the pi_teleop directory, you can go that route.

A simpler method is to use the small dhttpd web server.  First, install the dhttpd package as follows:

$ sudo apt-get install dhttpd

The dhttpd will attempt to start on port 80 immediately after being installed and may or may not be
successful depending on whether or not you are already using port 80.  In any event, kill this initial
process like this:

$ sudo pkill dhttpd

Now run the dhttpd process on an unpriviledge port like 8181 and set the 
pi_teleop directory as the document root.  The command to do this is:

$ dhttpd -p 8181 -r `rospack find pi_teleop`

To test that you have the webserver running correctly, bring up an HTML5 web browser like
Google Chrome and point to

http://localhost:8181/

You should see the pi_teleop GUI.

STEP 6: Testing with a Fake Robot

If you installed the ROS By Example stack in STEP 4 above, you can test many of the pi_teleop
controls using a fake robot and RViz.

First launch the fake robot, a test map, a move_base node, and fake localization:

$ roslaunch pi_teleop fake_pi_teleop.launch

Now fire up RViz:

$ rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find rbx1_nav`/nav_electric.vcg

Then, on the same machine, point your browser to:

http://localhost:8181/

If you already had this page up, click on the Reload button.

You should now be able to move the robot in RViz with the Base Control trackpad on the right of the 
pi_teleop interface and you can pan and tilt the head of the fake robot using the left trackpad.

Click on the Navigation tab and you can send the robot to different locations in the test map.

STEP 7: Testing on a Tablet or a different Computer

Once this is working, try it on a tablet on or another machine on your local network
using an HTML5 browser (e.g. Chrome) and point to:

http://a.b.c.d:8181/

where a.b.d.d is the IP address of the webserver machine.

Try the controls and observe the fake robot's motion in RViz.
